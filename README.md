# market_proj_1
Study of a power market problem using Matpower (in Matlab) and GAMS
Constrained and unconstrained AC OPF and DC OPF in the given network have been studied and the results are displayed and discussed.
Special thanks to 
[Alireza Soroudi ](https://github.com/OptimizationExpert/GAMS-DC--OPF-)https://github.com/OptimizationExpert/GAMS-DC--OPF-
for kindly giving idea to write GAMS code easier.
Inputs and outputs and everything are mentioned in "market_proj_1_report_najafi.pdf"
Good luck!
